# Ideas!

* Roguelike where your character is a sacrifice to some dungeon
  * Not very clever, but hey, it might work
  * Power: Damage, spell effect
  * Speed: Movement speed, defense, accuracy
  * Endurance: Health, carry weight, hp regeneration
  * Magic: More spell points, more spell point regeneration
    * Heal: Heals you
    * Fireball: Creates an explosion of flames at the target point
    * Invisibility
    * Sleep: Puts the target to sleep until it takes damage

* Game where you play as a viking.. or something.. and you're exploring the ocean. YOu have to sacrifice crewmembers, or something.

* Game where you have to sacrifice various... powers? to progress?

* Roguelike where somehow each time a player dies it gives everyone some advantage
  * Every time a player dies, it makes that level easier
